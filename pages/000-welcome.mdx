# Welcome to my Personal Blog

My name is Sandro, I have been a web developer for more than 10 years, with diversified experience in the creation of web apps.  
I live and work in the province of Padua (Italy), with my wife Luisa, my daughter Matile and his future sister (-4 months at birth - 27/06/2020).


## Objective

This blog is meant to be a small, unpretentious meeting point.  
My goal is to share my reflections and my personal works, tips and tricks hoping that they will be useful.  
I will try to write on a regular basis, free time permitting!

I will mainly deal with frontend programming in JavaScript/TypeScript and CSS, frontend architecture, UI/UX and Design System.

I am preparing some material for my next posts, in the meantime you could find some anticipation in my [repos on github](https://github.com/sandrolain).


```javascript
console.log("Happy reading!");
// and
console.log("See you soon!");
```
